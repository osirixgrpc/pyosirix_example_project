# Assets

This is one way of storing assets for your documentation.  Files that are not specific to the documentation, such as 
images, audio files, presentation and so on.  

__Note__ that these would likely be under version control, so it is worthwhile keeping their size and number to a 
minimum or you may end up bloating your repository for files that have little overall utility in your project.
